<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I was always fascinated by the amount of data social media generates on a daily basis. Utilizing this data can add quite interesting use-cases. I wanted to explore data from the social media website Twitter and analyze user tweets. Being able to showcase textual data in an intuitive and consumable manner can be very powerful while performing exploratory data analysis. In this repo, I have extracted user tweets based on certain hashtags. 


### Built With

* [PowerBi]()
* [Python]()
* [Twitterscraper, Twint, Tweety, Twitter API]()
